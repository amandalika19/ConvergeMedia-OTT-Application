        		text="Finding Go is a film documenting the life and legacy of Broderick Adé Hogue. An art director, designer, and letterer, Hogue’s influence was felt in many spheres across the country and even around the world. One of Hogue’s crowning achievements was creating the lettering for Our Commitment, a specially-designed 737 commissioned by Alaska Airlines in partnership with the United Negro College Fund to showcase their commitment to racial equality and education. By the time of Hogue’s death in the fall of 2021, he had impacted countless individuals through his presence and work. He is described as a true friend, an outgoing soul, and someone with an energy that made people want to be around him. This film chronicles his life from his early years in Asheville, NC, his college days at UNC Charlotte, and his eventual move to Chicago as his development into one of the best hand letterers of his generation."
